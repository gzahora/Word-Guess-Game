# Word-Guess-Game

This is a simple word-guess game with a national parks theme. It was created using a combination of html, javascript, bootstrap, and some light css.


## Getting Started

 1. Press any key to start guessing - but I recommend the space bar.
 2. Guess letters to determine word 
 3. If you guess correctly, you win the round
 4. If you run out of guesses, you lose the round

####### Tips: 
-- The "Number of Guesses Left countdown only goes down if you guess the wrong letter
-- Check to see the wrong guesses you already made at the bottom to narrow down your choices
-- It may help to have a list of the parks in front of you if you are not well-versed in U.S. and Canadain Natioanl Parks
